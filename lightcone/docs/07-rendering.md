# Rendering

Bevy 0.17, wgpu, WGSL. One shader set for native and browser.

## View modes

| mode | what it draws | who gets it |
|---|---|---|
| observer view | every object at its **retarded** state, as seen from the player's ship | players, default and usually only |
| god view | every object at coordinate time `t`, no delay | development, replays, spectators |

Observer view is the game. Each drawable is evaluated at its own retarded time, solved
against the camera's worldline, so a distant ship appears where it was when its light left
and a distant star shows the brightness it emitted years ago. Two objects in the same frame
are drawn at different source times, and that is correct.

God view removes the delay. It is necessary for debugging, for authoring, and for watching a
replay, and it destroys the game's premise if a player has it. Gate it behind a server
capability, not a client flag. Treat any client that requests it without the capability as
a client to disconnect.

Both modes share one scene graph. The difference is the time at which each worldline is
sampled, which is a parameter of the extract step, not a separate renderer.

## Scale tiers

Positions are `f64` in the simulation and `f32` on the GPU. WGSL has no `f64` at all, so all
reduction happens on the CPU before upload. `f32` has a 24-bit mantissa: at 1e11 m the ulp is
8 km, so absolute world coordinates are unusable and everything is camera-relative.

`src/presentation/render_space.rs` already implements this as
`ToRender::to_render_relative(scale, camera_render_pos)`, subtracting in `f64` and narrowing
after. It moves to `em-render` unchanged. Do not open-code the swizzle or the subtraction
anywhere else — the Z-up to Y-up conversion is a proper rotation, not a mirror, and getting
it wrong silently flips handedness.

Three tiers, each with its own scale factor and camera:

| tier | range | unit on the GPU | contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| surface | < 1e4 m | metres | a ship, a station, a structure's geometry |
| system | 1e4 to 1e14 m | scaled metres | planets, orbits, trajectories, in-system traffic |
| interstellar | > 1e14 m | light-years | stars as points, systems as markers, light cones |

Render tiers back to front into the same target with separate depth ranges, or composite
separate passes. Reverse-Z with an infinite far plane, per tier, keeps depth precision
usable; the standard forward-Z projection wastes almost all of its precision near the near
plane, which at these scale ratios means z-fighting on everything past a planet.

## Star rendering

Stars are points with a physically-derived colour and brightness, not billboards with a
fixed sprite. The existing path is `src/presentation/local_starfield*.rs` with
`src/catalog/spectral_color.rs`, driven by the HYG catalogue.

For the game, the brightness fed to that shader is not the catalogue's apparent magnitude.
It is `L(n, t_r) / d^2` from [04-stellar-photometry.md](04-stellar-photometry.md), evaluated
for the camera's direction and retarded time. A star that a rival's swarm is occluding is
dimmer in the sky, and it is dimmer because of the same function the telescope samples. The
starfield and the science instrument must not be two implementations.

Note the existing catalogue rotation: HYG is equatorial, the sim is ecliptic. That
conversion already exists and is the sort of thing that silently puts everything 23.4 degrees
out of place if duplicated.

## Light cones as geometry

Drawing a light cone is drawing an expanding sphere: radius `c * (t - t_emit)` about the
emission point. In observer view the visible intersection of a cone with the camera is a
single point, so cones are drawn only as an overlay, in the god view, or as a deliberate
UI affordance showing where a transmission has reached.

Implementation is an instanced unit sphere with a per-instance radius and a thin shell
shader. Cost is negligible and the spatial reasoning it supports — "has my message reached
them yet" — is central enough to justify a dedicated overlay.

## Shader portability

Target WebGPU as the baseline. WebGL2 as a fallback costs enough to be a separate decision:

| feature | WebGPU | WebGL2 |
|---|---|---|
| compute shaders | yes | no |
| storage buffers | yes | no; uniforms only, 64 KB typical limit |
| instancing | yes | yes |
| `f16` textures | yes | with extension |
| multiple render targets | yes | limited |

The emission-shell bake and any large per-instance data want storage buffers. Under WebGL2
they become textures, which is a real second code path. Recommendation: **WebGPU only, and
detect and refuse WebGL2 with a clear message**, until there is evidence the audience needs
it.

Rules for every shader written:

- No `f64`. WGSL does not have it.
- No platform-specific extensions without a WGSL-level fallback.
- Precision-critical arithmetic on the CPU, results uploaded as small `f32` deltas.
- Bevy's material abstraction over hand-written pipelines, so the native and WASM backends
  stay one code path.

## WASM specifics

| constraint | consequence |
|---|---|
| no threads without cross-origin isolation | ship `COOP`/`COEP` headers, or run Bevy single-threaded |
| no blocking IO | all asset loading async; no `std::fs` anywhere in the client's dependency tree |
| download size | `--release` with `opt-level = "s"`, `wasm-opt -Oz`, assets streamed not bundled |
| canvas sizing and input focus | Bevy handles it, but test the embedded case explicitly |

Single-threaded Bevy is the safe default. Cross-origin isolation breaks third-party embeds
and is worth taking only after profiling shows the render or extract stages are the
bottleneck.

## Performance shape

The object count per frame is bounded by what is *visible*, not by what exists. The
light-cone cursor from [02-event-store.md](02-event-store.md) already yields sources in
arrival order and prunes by strength, so the renderer takes the first N and stops. A sky
with 120 000 catalogue stars draws as one instanced point cloud; a system with 10 000 swarm
elements draws as one instanced mesh with per-instance orbital phase computed on the GPU
from elements uploaded once.

`PERF_AUDIT.md` in the repo root records the existing app's measured hot spots. Read it
before assuming where time goes in the shared crates.

## Open

- Whether observer view samples retarded time per object or per spatial cell. Per object is
  correct; per cell is cheaper and the error is below a pixel for anything far enough away
  to share a cell.
- Aberration and Doppler applied to the rendered starfield when the camera is relativistic.
  Correct, striking, and it makes the sky unusable for navigation at high beta, which may be
  the point.
- HDR and tone mapping. Stellar flux spans many orders of magnitude and a linear mapping
  shows either the Sun or everything else, never both.
- Whether the god view is exposed to players as a paid or post-game feature, or never.
